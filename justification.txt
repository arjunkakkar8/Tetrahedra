Type aaabcd
-----------

What the code searches for:
1. theta23, theta24, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n)
2. d12 = d13 = d14
3. n12, n13, n14 have the same parity and at most one is zero

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise theta12, theta13, theta14 are of the form 2pi/(2n).
So we can reduce to the 2pi/n case.

Type aabbcd
-----------

There is no code for this type.

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
We have theta14, theta23 are of the form 2pi/(2n).
The code for Type abcade covers this. [VERIFY LATER]

Type abaacb
-----------

What the code searches for:
1. theta24 is of the form 2pi/(2n)
2. d12 = d14 = d23
3. d13 = d34
4. n12, n14, n23 are even and at most one is zero
5. n13, n34 are even and nonzero

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise, either
I. theta12, theta14, theta23 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 4.)
II. theta13, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 5.)
or both.

If only I is true, then the code for Type abcade covers this. [VERIFY LATER]
If only II is true, then the code for Type abaacd covers this.
If both are true, then we can reduce to the 2pi/n case.

Type abaacd
-----------

What the code searches for:
[This code also covers part of abaacb]
1. theta13, theta24, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n)
2. d12 = d14 = d23
3. n12, n14, n23 are even and at most one is zero

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise theta12, theta14, theta23 are of the form 2pi/(2n).
So we can reduce to the 2pi/n case.

Type abcaaa
-----------

What the code searches for:
1. theta13, theta14 are of the form 2pi/(2n)
2. d12 = d23 = d24 = d34
3. n23, n24, n34 have the same parity
4. n12 is even
5. at most two of n12, n23, n24, n34 are zero

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise theta12, theta23, theta24, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n).
So we can reduce to the 2pi/n case.

Type abcacb
-----------

What the code searches for:
1. d12 = d23
2. d13 = d34
3. d14 = d24
4. n12, n23 are even and nonzero
5. n13, n34 are even and nonzero
6. n14, n24 are even and nonzero

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise, at least one of the following is true
I. theta12, theta23 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 4.)
II. theta13, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 5.)
III. theta14, theta24 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 6.)
