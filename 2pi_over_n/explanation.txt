The files should be run in this order.

search.m
--------

1. Perform search and output dihedral angles

2. Compute face areas from dihedral angles

verify_eq.nb
------------
Use dihedral angles from search.m

3. Verify that the determinant is zero symbolically

verify_ineq.py
--------------
Use dihedral angles and face areas from search.m

4. Compute edge lengths from dihedral angles and face areas

5. Check that edge lengths form a tetrahedron, except for the Cayley-Menger determinant condition

6. Check that these edge lengths give original face areas

7. Check that these edge lengths and face areas give original dihedral angles

volume.m
--------
Use dihedral angles and face areas from search.m
Use edge lengths from verify_ineq.py

8. Compute volume, and thereby checking the Cayley-Menger determinant condition that was missing from 5.

9. Compute normalized surface areas
