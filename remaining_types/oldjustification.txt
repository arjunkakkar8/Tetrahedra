Type aaabcd
-----------

What the code searches for:
1. theta23, theta24, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n)
2. d12 = d13 = d14
3. n12, n13, n14 have the same parity and at least two are nonzero
4. d12 != d23, d12 != d24, d12 != d34

Note that it is okay to enforce 4. because no other type shares this code.

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise theta12, theta13, theta14 are of the form 2pi/(2n).
So we can reduce to the 2pi/n case.

Type aabbcd
-----------

There is no code for this type.

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
We have
1. theta14, theta23, theta24, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n)
2. d12 = d13
3. d14 = d23
4. at least one of these is true
   4a. n12, n13 are even and nonzero
   4b. theta12, theta13 are of the form 2pi/(2n)

If 4a is true, then the code for Type abcade covers this (with some permutation).
If 4b is true, then we can reduce to the 2pi/n case.

Type abaacb
-----------

What the code searches for:
1. theta24 is of the form 2pi/(2n)
2. d12 = d14 = d23
3. d13 = d34
4. n12, n14, n23 are even and at least two are nonzero
5. n13, n34 are even and nonzero

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise, at least one of the following is true
I. theta12, theta14, theta23 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 4.)
II. theta13, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 5.)

If only I is true, then the code for Type abcade covers this (with some permutation).
If only II is true, then the code for Type abaacd covers this.
If both are true, then we can reduce to the 2pi/n case.

Type abaacd
-----------

1. theta13, theta24, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n)
2. d12 = d14 = d23
3. n12, n14, n23 are even and at least two are nonzero

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise theta12, theta14, theta23 are of the form 2pi/(2n).
So we can reduce to the 2pi/n case.

Type abcaaa

3. n12, n23, n24 have the same parity
4. n34 is even
5. at least two of n12, n23, n24, n34 are nonzero

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise theta12, theta23, theta24, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n).

Type abcacb
-----------

What the code searches for:
1. d12 = d23
2. d13 = d34
3. d14 = d24
4. n12, n23 are even and nonzero
5. n13, n34 are even and nonzero
6. n14, n24 are even and nonzero

Justification for the remaining possibilities:
Otherwise, at least one of the following is true
I. theta12, theta23 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 4.)
II. theta13, theta34 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 5.)
III. theta14, theta24 are of the form 2pi/(2n) (breaks 6.)

Note the cyclic symmetry in I, II, and III.
If only II is true, then the code for Type abcacd covers this.
If only II and III are true, then the code for Type abcade covers this.
If all are true, then we can reduce to the 2pi/n case.
