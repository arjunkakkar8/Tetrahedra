Elimination note:

aaabcd: 224 cases -> 7 cases -> 2 cases
abaacb: 396 cases -> 1 case -> 1 case
abaacd: 315 cases -> 8 cases -> 2 cases
abcaaa: 459 cases -> 0 cases
abcacb: 91 cases -> 0 cases
abcacd: 324 cases -> 6 cases -> 1 case
abcade: 144 cases -> 5 cases -> 0 cases
abccbb: 54 cases -> 2 cases -> 1 case
abcddd: 67 cases -> 0 cases

Remaining cases note:

aaabcd: [use solid angle?]
abaacb: [surface area is worse than sommerville]
abaacd: Both cases remaining belong to the 1st Goldberg family
abcaaa: No cases remain
abcacb: No cases remain
abcacd: We prove that the 1 case remaining must belong to the 2nd Goldberg family
abcade: No  cases remain
abccbb: The 1 case remaining belongs to the 1st Goldberg family
abcddd: No cases remain

Proof note:

aaabcd: All cases match
abaacb: All cases match
abaacd: All cases match
abcaaa: All cases match
abcacb: All cases match
abcacd: All cases match
abcade: All cases match
abccbb: All cases match
abcddd: Found 1 extra case but can be discarded
